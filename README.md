# Custom-Command-Prompt
Badly made, Non optimized, Feature - missing command prompt
You can modify it as you see fit. however, editing out the more "Unprofessional" features is against the artists vision for the program and will damage the artistic integrity of said program.

!WARNING! The command prompt has developed a taste for random access memory under the pretense that it needs it to remember what was written to it previously, which can lead it to
take up to 120 Mb of RAM, and possibly more. Do not, under any circumstance, feed the command prompt ram as it will always desire more and more.
